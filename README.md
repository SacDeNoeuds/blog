# Blog

Here I intend to add one-by-one my today-I-learned and discoveries in the shape of blog post. The exercise forces one to understand deeper a subject when writing.

That's one of the 2 reasons why I write posts – here and there –, the second reason being sharing knowledge.

Built With AstroPaper: a minimal, responsive, accessible and SEO-friendly Astro blog theme.
